# React Studio

Use this stencil code to get started!

Make sure you're signed into your GitHub account (either real or anonymous is fine for this).

If you do not follow these three steps for forking, your react app WILL NOT DEPLOY CORRECTLY!

1) Click the green **"Use this template"** button to initiate a copy of the repository on your own account.

2) In the menu, set the name to `react-studio` and **make it Public**

3) Lastly, **check "Include all branches"**

Then, clone your new repository and open it in your editor of choice.

## Getting started

First, make sure you install all dependencies by running `npm install` in the project directory.

Then, in the project directory, you can run `npm start` to run the app in the development mode.

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.

You may also see any lint errors in the console.

## Deploying

We've included a GitHub Actions workflow that will automatically deploy your React app to GitHub Pages every time you push to the `main` branch. You can visit your site by visiting https://\<your GitHub username\>.github.io/react-studio
